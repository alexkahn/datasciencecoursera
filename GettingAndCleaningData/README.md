## With a catchy subtitle
Here's where you can find a script for cleaning the UCI HAR Data set and a `.txt` file with some squeaky-clean data as specified in the peer assesment requirements.

The script `run_analysis.R` contains all of the code, executable from the directory in which the `test` and `train` directories are located (with the required test and train text files respectively) as well as the file `features.txt` in the current directory (or working directory).

The codebook (which is a little ambiguous in the directions) contains a step-by-step walkthrough of the code as well as some illustrations of why I made certain decisions. The information asked for in the directions is also there but is a bit redundant if you've read the files included with the data.
